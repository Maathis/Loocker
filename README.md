## ‚ú® Features

### üîí Encryption Algorithms
- **AES-256-GCM**: Industry-standard symmetric encryption with authenticated encryption
- **RSA-OAEP**: Asymmetric encryption with SHA-256 hashing for secure key exchange
- **Multiple Key Sources**: Support for passphrases and key files

### üß™ Recipe System
Create custom encryption recipes with multiple layers of protection:
- **Sequential Encryption**: Chain multiple encryption algorithms in any order
- **Mixed Algorithms**: Combine symmetric and asymmetric encryption in a single recipe
- **Drag & Drop**: Easily reorder encryption steps with intuitive drag-and-drop interface
- **Visual Configuration**: Step-by-step recipe builder with clear algorithm selection

### üéØ Key Management
- **RSA Key Generation**: Built-in RSA key pair generator with configurable key sizes (2048-bit default)
- **PEM Format Support**: Import/export keys in standard PEM format
- **Key File Support**: Use existing key files for encryption operations
- **Passphrase Support**: Simple passphrase-based encryption for quick operations

### üìÅ File Operations
- **Batch Processing**: Encrypt or decrypt multiple files simultaneously
- **File Selection**: Drag-and-drop file selection with support for any file type
- **Automatic Naming**: Encrypted files automatically get `.enc` extension
- **Local Export**: Save encrypted/decrypted files to any local directory

### üé® User Interface
- **Modern Design**: Clean, responsive interface built with Tailwind CSS
- **Dark/Light Theme**: Adaptive theming with DaisyUI components
- **Smooth Animations**: Fluid transitions and micro-interactions
- **Cross-Platform**: Native desktop experience on Windows, macOS, and Linux

## üìñ Usage Guide

### Basic Encryption
1. **Select Files**: Drag and drop files or click to browse
2. **Configure Recipe**: Add encryption steps using the recipe builder
3. **Set Keys**: Provide passphrases or import key files
4. **Encrypt**: Click "Encrypt files" and choose save location

### Creating Encryption Recipes
1. **Add Steps**: Click the "+" button to add encryption layers
2. **Choose Algorithm**: Select from AES-256-GCM or RSA-OAEP
3. **Configure Keys**: Set up passphrases or import key files
4. **Reorder Steps**: Drag steps to change encryption order
5. **Save Recipe**: Your recipe is automatically saved for the session

### RSA Key Generation
1. **Open Key Generator**: Click "Generate Keys" in the RSA step configuration
2. **Choose Key Size**: Select 2048-bit (recommended) or 4096-bit
3. **Generate**: Click "Generate Key Pair"
4. **Export Keys**: Copy to clipboard or save as PEM files

### Decryption
1. **Select Encrypted Files**: Choose `.enc` files to decrypt
2. **Configure Recipe**: Set up the same recipe used for encryption
3. **Provide Keys**: Enter the same keys used during encryption
4. **Decrypt**: Click "Decrypt files" and choose save location
